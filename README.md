# Sentiment Analysis and Spam Detection with NLP

In this project, I've developed a system for sentiment analysis and spam detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project focuses on classifying text data into sentiment categories and identifying spam messages effectively.

## Sentiment Analysis

- Sentiment analysis determines the sentiment of text data, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.
- The model is trained on labeled sentiment datasets to make accurate predictions.

## Spam Detection

- Spam detection involves identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate ones.
- NLP techniques, including stemming, are used to preprocess text data and improve spam detection accuracy.

## Model Architecture

I've designed and implemented custom NLP models for both sentiment analysis and spam detection, optimized for performance and efficiency.

## Data Preprocessing

Robust data preprocessing techniques, including stemming and other NLP processes, are applied to enhance model effectiveness in handling real-world text data.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is assessed using relevant NLP metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for sentiment analysis, and accuracy, false positives, and false negatives for spam detection.
